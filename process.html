    <div class="wow fadeIn"><p class="researchtext2">From this I learned: most period apps have a <b>daily view,<br>
  calendar view </b>& <b>profile</b>, generally listed in that order. <br>

  troubleshooting. It’s easy for <b>data displays </b>& symptom <br>

revision

<!--REFLECTION-->
<div class="reflectioncontainer">
  <h2 class="reflectionheader"> the reflection.</h2>
  <p class="reflection">First and foremost, this process taught me about the importance of research and revision. As someone new to app design, I made sure to take notes from the makers of well-known apps who likely have conducted thorough research and have greater experience with UI/UX. I spent most of my time on this project using and discovering apps that were already out there & talking with people who used female health trackers in order discover what was going well and what was missing in an already established industry.
<p>
  <p class="reflection">I was also very concerned with the tone and “branding” of the application as a whole. Similarly to researching the visual design and content, I also looked for brands/applications that made an effort to portray themselves as empathetic and  knowledgeable about user needs. Some examples I found particularly inspiring were Ritual, Headspace and Thinx. They placed an emphasis on recognizing the “struggles” their users were facing and gave solutions to them in a way that, despite likely being the product of a marketing team, seemed like they genuinely cared.
<p>
<p class="reflection">Finally, it was important that all of the information the application was built on to be correct and relevant. After delving deeper into the topic of female health and finding all sorts of statistics, I wanted this hypothetical application to also be prototyped in the name of social change. As much as this is just a women’s health app, I hope that (theoretically) educating women (and men) about the basic biology of our bodies is helpful & empowering.
<p>
<p class="reflection">This course has given me proficiency in XD as well as an in-depth understanding of design principles and how they apply to the real world. I now have an appreciation for the value of digital interaction and hope to integrate more motion graphics and interactions with future projects, both in and out of the Interactive Media program.
<p>
<p class="reflection2">From this project specifically, I have realized that I am passionate about projects that occur at the intersection of design, social justice & data. I can’t wait to work on more of them and am excited for the rest of my time in the program!
